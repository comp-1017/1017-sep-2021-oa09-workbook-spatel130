        Most tag elements in html are done in pairs
        These are called opening and closing pairs
        The opening tag indicates the element being request
        The closing tag indicates the element is complete
        The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag PLUS
            a slash (/) preceeding the name
        
        Normally you will specify the lang of the code on the web page
        use the lang element parameter to specify your coding lang

        <h3>Paragraph tag</h3>
        <!-- this is the coding block for your content in a paragraph tag
             a paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags
             "block" group of tags places your content on a new line-->
            <p>
                The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line in your 
                displayed web page on the browser. The browser does NOT display your content 
                in the physical style of how you have entered your code in your html file.
            </p>
            <p>This is my second paragrpah on the displayed browser page. 
                It will start a new line.
            </p>
            <!--if you wish to use a component of a reserved tag (or the
                whole tag) you would be in trouble using the tag 
                instead: you can use special character strings to 
                represent components of the tag such as the < (&lt) and
                the > (&gt) symbols-->
